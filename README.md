# fractions
Playing around with creating my own system for fractions in Python

Todo:

-Testing on Python 3 (this was developed using Python 2.7.3)

-Complete move over from controller method (now deprecated but still valid), test new squaring function to ensure it still works

-Fully test fraction addition

-Fully test fraction subtraction

-Fully test the mixed fraction code (and shorten any code that can be removed easily)

-Better handling of fractions with 0 in the denominator

-Better handling of fractions that are equal to 1 (reducing down to 1, not 1/1) and 0 (reducing down to zero)

-Implement square rooting (both exact and decimal forms)

-Potential redesign of the quick and dirty testing system

-Add more tests to the testing system
