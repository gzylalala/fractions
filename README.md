# fractions
Playing around with creating my own system for fractions in Python

Todo:

-Fully test fraction addition

-Fully test fraction subtraction

-Better handling of fractions with 0 in the denominator

-Better handling of fractions that are equal to 1 (reducing down to 1, not 1/1) and 0 (reducing down to zero)

-(Hopefully) move away from the controller model of handling operations between fractions (will need some research and thought but should hopefully be doable)
